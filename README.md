# SimulAmbient

SimulAmbient is a snRNA-seq counts matrix simulator that provides snRNA-seq data scientists with tools to evaluate snRNA-seq methods or metrics on both ground truth counts data and contaminated counts data. The intended audience for SimulAmbient is snRNA-seq researchers with a post-quality control snRNA-seq counts dataset for which they would like to estimate ground truth and variants of that ground truth data with varying levels of ambient RNA contamination.
